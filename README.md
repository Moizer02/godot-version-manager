## Installation
### Windows:
Unzip and double-click. (On Windows XP please make sure Powershell is installed)

Unzip and double-click. Extraction of downloaded versions requires `unzip` which, if not installed, should be available in your distro repository
### OSX:
- Should auto extract after download
- You need to run `sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine path/to/Godot Version Manager.app` since unsigned binaries get marked as untrusted otherwise. Feel free to build the project yourself if you don't trust the prebuilt binaries
- Double click Godot Version Manager.app

## F.A.Q
**Q: Where are the downloaded binaries saved to?**

A: They are saved to `user://versions` which varies depending on your platform. On windows it's %appdata%/Godot/app_serdata/Godot Version Manager/versions

**Q: How is this different from Hourglass or Godot Manager?**

A:
 - [Hourglass](https://hourglass.jwestman.net/) is a much more mature and featureful project with better support for project management. Maybe the only advantage GVM has is that it also downloads news snippets from the official website :)
 - [Godot Manager](https://github.com/eumario/godot-manager) seems to be a pretty mature and featureful alternative too.
 - [Godots](https://github.com/MakovWait/godots) is a new (Aug 2023) alternative that a lot of people seem to like.
 - [GodotEnv](https://github.com/chickensoft-games/GodotEnv) and [godot-version-manager](https://github.com/gaheldev/godot-version-manager) are CLI-only alternatives.
 - [Godot Launcher](https://github.com/sebastianoboem/godot-launcher) is a python-based alternative with support for extension and cache management.
